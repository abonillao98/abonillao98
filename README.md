## 🎯 About Me

I have always been passionate about technology. My journey started with an Intermediate and later an Advanced Vocational Training Course in computer science, after which I worked in the industry for two years.  
This experience motivated me to pursue engineering studies at UPC, where I built a strong foundation in:

- Mathematics  
- Programming  
- Signal theory & processing  
- Electronics  
- Networks  

During my third year, I chose the **Audiovisual Systems** specialization, where I discovered my real interests:  
**computer vision, multimedia processing, and AI applied to image and video analysis**.
